<h1 class="hero-heading" style="color: #6B7280">Solution Overview:</h1>

Our team presents a comprehensive solution to combat global food wastage, addressing key touchpoints throughout the supply chain. 
Employing a Swiss knife approach, our multifaceted strategy begins with educating farmers on improved practices to preserve land fertility. 
We integrate cold storage and freeze-drying technologies to prevent food spoilage during transportation and rescue items on the brink of disposal. In the restaurant sector, we advocate for on-the-go, made-to-order cooking methods using innovative kitchen equipment. Our commitment to sustainability is evident in the use of eco-friendly packaging materials crafted from natural sources, such as decomposable tree leaves. 
This holistic approach creates a sustainable and efficient system, reducing food waste and promoting food security.

<h1 class="hero-heading" style="color: #6B7280">Context:</h1>

The history of global food waste reveals a significant disconnect, challenging the notion that increased food production alone can solve hunger. The scope of the wicked problem extends globally, with one billion tons of food wasted annually. Stakeholders, including farmers, restaurant owners, consumers, policymakers, and environmentalists, are deeply impacted. This issue is not confined to specific geographic locations, affecting countries worldwide. 
The lack of education and awareness poses a formidable barrier, emphasizing the need for collaborative and widespread solutions.

<h1 class="hero-heading" style="color: #6B7280">Solution Impact Assessment:</h1>
Our solution's impact is profound, addressing diverse stages of the supply chain and minimizing waste at its source. 
Unique value lies in the economic feasibility, innovation, and creation of effective flows. 
The outcomes extend beyond immediate stakeholders, fostering positive changes in environmental sustainability and driving a significant shift in industry practices toward a more efficient and eco-friendly future. Our solution challenges the belief that sustainability comes with a hefty price tag, emphasizing economic benefits while minimizing hunger and waste.

<h1 class="hero-heading" style="color: #6B7280">Barrier Acknowledgment:</h1>
One significant barrier recognized is the lack of education and awareness surrounding the solution. 
To overcome this, our plan involves educating the public through case studies, tailored training programs, and initiating dialogues with stakeholders. 
Behavioral change and addressing the interconnected nature of food wastage are also acknowledged challenges, with strategies in place to encourage a shift in production methods and promote interconnected thinking. 
Utilizing varied communication channels is crucial to ensuring widespread awareness and adoption of our holistic solution.

<br><br><b>4)Different perspectives after analysis</b>

<br>
Three perspectives can be distinguished. 
<br>Firstly, the <b>organizational</b> perspective focuses on the actors. 
<br>Secondly, the <b>control-flow</b> perspective, focusses on the flow and structuredness of the process. 
<br>Finally, the <b>performance</b> perspective, focusses on time and efficiency. 
<br>Furthermore, we can also combine different perspectives, for example investigate whether there are links between actors and performance issues. 
Additional data attributes which are available, such as the cost of activities or types of customers, can also be included.

<br><br>

<b>5)Exploring the sequence of activities</b>

<br>The sequence in which the activities occurs is called the trace of the case.
<br>A list of the traces can be retrieved with the `traces` function, or they can be visualized using the `trace_explorer`.
<br>For student 1, we see a very structured path, progressing through the different exercises, and finally doing the assessment. 
<br>However, student 2 starts with looking at the theory pages, before doing exercise 1, which he executes two times in a row.

    <img class="hero-img" src="images/Sequence_of_activities.jpg" />
    <h2 class="hero-heading">
       
        </h2>
</header>

<b>6)Process maps</b>
<br>
<br>Another way to visualize processes is by constructing a process map.
<br>A process map is a directed graph that shows the activities of the process and the flows between them.
<br>The colors of the nodes and the thickness of the arrows indicate the most frequent activities and process flows.
<br>
<br>

<b>7)Different components of process data:</b>
<ul>
    <li>
<b>1.Events</b>
<br><br>If we take a closer look at the X-Ray activity execution for John, we would see that it was scheduled during registration at 9:51. 
It actually started at 10:42, and was finished at 10:58. Each of these time recordings is called an event. 
<br>

    <img class="hero-img" src="images/components_events.jpg" />
    <h2 class="hero-heading">
       
        </h2>
</header>
<br>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>2.Event log</b>

        <br><br>A log book of events is called an event log. 
        <br>For our current example, the event log looks as shown here. 
        <br>There are two registration instances, for which only a start event is recorded (the arrival of the patient), and there is 1 X-ray instance which consists of 3 events.
        <header class="hero">
            <img class="hero-img" src="images/Event_log.jpg" />
            <h2 class="hero-heading">
               
                </h2>
        </header>
</li> 
<li>
    <b>3.Resources
    </b>
    
    <br><br>Another component of process data are the resources.
    <br> Resources are the actors in the process. 
    <br>In our example, there are three resources: Mr. Owens and Mr. Fleming who performed the registration of John and Emily, respectively, and Dr. Russell who performed the X-ray. 
    
    <header class="hero">
        <img class="hero-img" src="images/Resources.jpg" />

    8)Different perspectives after analysis
</b>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Organizational Analysis</b></li>
    <header class="hero">
        <img class="hero-img" src="images/Organizational_analysis.jpg" />
        <h2 class="hero-heading">
           
            </h2>
    </header>
    <br><b>Who</b> executes the work?
<br>In order to know who executes the work, we can take a look at the resource labels, using the resource_labels function. 
<br>We can see that there are 12 resources in this example process: doctors, nurses, clercks and an emergency crew.
<br>
<br>
We can also create a resource-activity matrix which shows what resource in your organization performs what task.
<header class="hero">
    <img class="hero-img" src="images/Resource_activity_matrix.jpg" />
    <h2 class="hero-heading">
       
        </h2>
</header>
Specialization and Brain drain:
<br>When a person performs relatively few activities, we can say that this person is specialized, like person 3 and 4 in this example. 
<br>Knowing the specializations of your work-force is very important from a knowledge management perspective: knowing who to go to for a specific issue, or knowing who to enlist for specific trainings.
<header class="hero">
    <img class="hero-img" src="images/Specialization and brain drain.jpg" />
    <h2 class="hero-heading">
       
        </h2>
</header>
<br>On the other hand, it can also occur that only one person is in charge of a certain activity, like the forth activity in this example. 
<br>This presents an important risk in terms of knowledge retention: if the person leaves the company, you might suffer an important loss of knowledge concerning this step of the process.

<br>
<br>
    <li><b>Control-flow analysis</b></li>
    The structuredness of the process.
<br>When we look at structuredness, we often speak of "control-flow". 
<br>Control-flow refers to the different successions of activities, like in the example we saw of the different students. 
<br>Recall that each case can be expressed as a sequence of activities. 
<br>Each unique sequence is called a trace or process variant.
<br>There are several ways to look at the variants of the process. 
On one hand, we have several metrics which we can use to look at one specific aspect of the process: 
start and end activities, 
the distribution of the case length, 
which activities are always present in a case and 
which are exceptional.
<br>
<br>
There are various visual tools to look at control-flow patterns:
<br>
<br><b>Process map</b>

    <li><b>Performance analysis</b>
    </li>
</ul>




<b>9)Linking different perspectives</b>
<br>
For each of these aspects, we used process metrics, which return various numeric results, as well as visuals, which return maps of the process as well as other process-specific graphs, like dotted charts. 
While each of these aspects is important in its own right, it is also interesting to look at the links between them and between any additional information we have stored in our data. 
<br><br>For example, is there a relation between the actors working on a case, and the order in which the work is done. How is the order in which the work is done related to the efficiency in terms of throughput time? Or are there differences in how different resources plan and execute their work in terms of time schedules?
