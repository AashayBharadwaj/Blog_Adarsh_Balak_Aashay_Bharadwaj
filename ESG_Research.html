        </h2>


        <h3 class="hero-heading">
            I'm currently immersed in a dynamic project that marries my enthusiasm for sustainability with tech innovation and teamwork. 
            This ongoing effort focuses on the vital world of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting within academic institutions. 
            Collaborating with UTD's Sustainability Director and innovative startup CopperWire, I'm leading a drive to refine ESG reporting methods and bolster sustainability outcomes. Through research, strategic partnerships, and tech integration, 
            I'm bridging the gap between university sustainability initiatives and modern digital solutions.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this ongoing venture, my collaboration with UTD's Sustainability Director and CopperWire forms the core. 
            Our mission is to revolutionize how universities handle ESG reporting by tapping into technology and teamwork.
