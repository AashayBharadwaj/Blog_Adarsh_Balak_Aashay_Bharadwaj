        As part of our ongoing venture, we are actively engaged in ESG reporting, particularly for <b style="color:blue">AASHE STARS(Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System).</b> 
        <br>AASHE, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, is a globally recognized organization committed to advancing sustainability practices within academic institutions. 
        <br><br>
        AASHE STARS is their flagship program, providing universities and colleges with a comprehensive framework to assess, track, and communicate their sustainability efforts. 
        <br>This robust system covers a diverse range of categories and metrics, including environmental impact, social responsibility, and governance practices.

                <br>
                
                The first step of the project involved identifying the gaps in the current system.
                We did this by going through the publicyly available data on <a href="https://stars.aashe.org/"><b>AASHE's</b></a> webstie.

                    <br>
                After finding these gaps we worked with the Sustainability Director at the University to understand the other pain points in the reporting process.
                <br>Upon talking to the director we found that there were a lot of processes that were labor intensive and had a lot of manual processes to collect the data.
                <br>In order to optimize these processes we carried out the process mapping for them to understand them in detail.

            <h2 style="color: black">Reporting Academic Credits</h2>
            <p>As part of our demonstration for universities, our primary focus was on addressing the academic credits associated with the STAR framework, specifically <b>AC1, AC2,& AC9 </b> which emphasizes sustainability-focused academic courses, learning outcomes and research focus in the University.</p>

            <p>The AC1 metric reporting endeavor required the collection of various data points.
                 These encompassed the following:</p>
            
    <ul>
        <li>Total number of undergraduate courses offered by the institution</li>
        <li>Number of undergraduate courses offered that have a sustainability focus</li>
        <li>Number of undergraduate courses offered that incorporate sustainability content</li>
        <li>Total number of graduate courses offered by the institution</li>
        <li>Number of graduate courses offered with a sustainability focus</li>
        <li>Number of graduate courses offered that include sustainability content</li>
        <li>Total number of academic departments offering courses at any level</li>
        <li>Number of academic departments offering sustainability-focused courses</li>
        <li>Submission of the institution's inventory of sustainability course offerings and descriptions (uploaded)</li>
        <li>Clarification on whether the reported figures span one, two, or three academic years</li>
        <li>A concise explanation of the methodology used to compile the course inventory, including how the total number of courses offered was determined and how sustainability course offerings were identified. This should encompass definitions and the validation process.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>One of the most significant challenges we encountered in reporting this metric was sourcing accurate data. Once the data source was identified, the process involved manually reviewing thousands of course descriptions to determine their relevance to sustainability.</p>

    <p>Our current approach utilizes a set of keywords aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to filter the courses. However, this method resulted in a list of false positives that necessitated manual review before proceeding with the submission.</p>
    <p>By utilizing CopperWire's solution we aim at eliminating the manual processes involved at extracting the data and reviewing it.
