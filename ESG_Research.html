         <p>
            I'm currently immersed in a dynamic project that marries my enthusiasm for sustainability with tech innovation and teamwork. 
            <br>This ongoing effort focuses on the vital world of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) reporting within academic institutions. 
            Collaborating with UTD's Sustainability Director and innovative startup CopperWire, I'm leading a drive to refine ESG reporting methods and bolster sustainability outcomes. Through research, strategic partnerships, and tech integration, 
            <br>I'm bridging the gap between university sustainability initiatives and modern digital solutions.
            <br>
            <br>
            In this ongoing venture, my collaboration with UTD's Sustainability Director and CopperWire forms the core. 
            Our mission is to revolutionize how universities handle ESG reporting by tapping into technology and teamwork.

                <b>Analyzing Gaps and Mapping Processes:</b>
                <br>
                
                The first step of the project involved identifying the gaps in the current system.
                We did this by going through the publicyly available data on AASHE's(The association for the advancement of sustainability in higher education) webstie.
                <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                After finding these gaps we worked with the Sustainability Director at the University to understand the other pain points in the reporting process.
                <br>Upon talking to the director we found that there were a lot of processes that were labor intensive and had a lot of manual processes to collect the data.
                <br>In order to optiize these processes we carried out the process mapping for them to understand them in detail.

                Through AI and blockchain, we're building an ESG reporting tool. 
                This digital solution automates tasks, improving accuracy and efficiency. 
                The integration of blockchain enhances data credibility.

                The ongoing implementation of the AI tool streamlines reporting, reducing errors and enhancing data precision. 
                This directly contributes to measurable advancements in sustainability.

                Ultimately, our project is about making university ESG reporting more impactful. 
                By boosting transparency, efficiency, and accuracy, we're enabling better sustainability decisions.
