    <p>
        To understand the origin and evolution of currencies we need to look back at least 3000 years in history.
        Humans used to exchange goods for goods that we call the barter system. 
        Around 1200 BC currencies used for trading were animal skins, weapons and agricultural products. 
        This changed in 1100 BC when chinese used the small replica casts of the weapons as the exchange goods.
        These casts were replicated on circular shaped bronze metals which are considered the beginning of coinage.
        It was in the 6th century BC that Lydia’s king created the first official currency.
        The coins were stamped with pictures that appeared to be the denominations.
        Lydia used gold coins for trade and the standard means of exchange, now the exchange of goods turned into purchase of goods.
        While  Lydia was dominating in the use of currency, China started the use of paper money instead of coins.
        Europe was using coins till1600 AD, after which the banks started using notes which could be exchanged for gold or silver coins.
        The notes were used by banks and personal institutions and not by the government.
        The first paper note was issued by the colonial government in North America..
        The use of paper currency increased international trades and banks started buying currencies from different countries that formed the first currency market.

    <p>
    Why is there so much hype around blockchain technology?
    There have been many attempts to create digital money in the past, but they have always failed.
    The prevailing issue is trust. If someone creates a new currency called the X dollar, how can we trust that they won't give themselves a million X dollars, or steal your X dollars for themselves?
    Bitcoin was designed to solve this problem by using a specific type of database called a blockchain.
    Most normal databases, such as an SQL database, have someone in charge who can change the entries (e.g. giving themselves a million X dollars). Blockchain is different because nobody is in charge; it’s run by the people who use it. 
    What’s more, bitcoins can’t be faked, hacked or double spent – so people that own this money can trust that it has some value.
