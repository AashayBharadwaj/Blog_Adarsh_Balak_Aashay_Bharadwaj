        <h2 class="hero-heading">One of the biggest struggles I've seen people have in GMAT is the <br><span class="heading-inverted">RC and CR section</span> in verbal 
              
        </h2>


        <h3 class="hero-heading">
            The passages presented are horrendous for everyone but Americans!This is one point that people should notice!
            Why do the Americans not struggle with the verbal section as much as the people from the rest of the world do?
            The answer lies in the content of the passages and CR topics!
            GMAT is predominantly filled with excerpts from American History and the lack of familiarity is what makes the verbal section tough for the others.
            For example, for an Indian, if the passage is talking something about 1947 in India, we'll already know that this has got something to do with our independence. It'll be something about the Britishers retreating from our land. It'll be about two big nations being formed on our continent!
            Just a mere reference to date has already given you multiple points!
            Since the GMAT is based on American History! It's good to know a little bit of history.
            Now we can't really go and read big fat books for this!
            Here I'll give out chronological bullet points about the significant events that have transpired in the US.

    <p>
         
    To start with the American history we need to rewind a little.
    At the very beginning, we need to talk about Christopher Columbus who accidentally sailed to America when in reality he was trying to find a shorter route to India.
    That was when the New World was discovered.
    Columbus never found this truth out. But nevertheless, this accidental discovery is the reason why we are where we are today.
    Without the daring venture carried out by Columbus we would have never discovered this land, we might have still lived for a couple of centuries believing in the bible according to which the world was the earth was flat, it was only 6000 years old, and the only land that existed was Egypt, Israel, and Cyprus. Based on this if we ever ventured out beyond a point in the ocean we would magically fall off some cliff. This was the level of ridiculousness that the majority of the old world(mainly Europe) believed in.
    And Columbus's discovery did not simply challenge the bible but it completely dismantled it.  It kickstarted the new world.

    A couple of more things about Columbus. 
    He is one of the best Entrepreneurs the world has ever witnessed.
    He completely entered into an unknown territory.
    Most of the people he approached rejected his idea. Only 1 king in spain agreed to this unpopular venture of his.
    He had no map of where he was going, he had no clue how many men to take with him? No clue about how much food he'll need. But he risked his entire life based on his one idea! Which Kickstarted the New world, the reason why we can call our world Modern today.

        There are a couple of reasons why America is so successful ! Some predominant factors are:- 
It is the land of opportunity!
Entrepreneurship is celebrated as opposed to communist and solicalist nations where there is little private ownership! 
It's the land of a free enterprise system! Capitalism is at the heart of US economy!
Geographyically as well it faces little threat from any nation! 
9/11 was the very first significant attack on the US soil.
They are heavily invested in SCI&Tech and R&D. THey've got the strongest Military! Top brands comes from the US!
Europe describes the US as the global hegemonic power.

It can be argued that the US was an accidental superpower . Primary reason being the fact the war took place on a foriegn soil for the US. They entered at the time when all nations were on the verge of exhaustion. They just had to deliver the 'coup de grace'.
But the intent to dominate the world post that was all planned.
You can surely hear about a lot of rich nations and empires and individuals who accidentally become powerful but very few are able to keep the tag intact.
The planned domination was the kickstarted by Mr Harry Truman !
In 1945 US dropped Atomic bomb on japan! Uk had already collapsed becasue of the war. In 1951, Truman called a meeting with, representatives from top universities, corporates, psychologists,hollywood,anthropologists,ethonologists,homeland security, department of state,treasury, NSA, Federal Reserve.

The agenda of the meeting was to not just accept that The US as an acciental superpower but also to figure out a way to maintain the same status for the next 50 years.
Truman wasnt very much impressed by the answers he got from the reps.
So he formulated an idea:
He asked Unis to have a max investment in RD patents innovation, Nobel prizes no mediocre research, all have to be around the business.
If Americans were dumb then import the best talents from other nations. Even Russians were invited. For this GMAT and GRE were invented. GMAT was started in 1953.

Corporates were told to work with Universities. Don't just create products but  Create brands, use psychological slavery. 
USe psychologists to create this slavery on the consumers.
Hollywood was used to painting a perfect picture of the US. The advertisements made everyone crave for living in the USA.

Homeland security, NSA were told to make life easier for Immigrants. Make the immigrants comfortable. (this was true till 9/11)
The Federal reserve was told to give scholarships to the deserving.

This led to the best of best in the US! 
GM, GOogle, Facebook, amazon, 
Harvard, Stamford,
The idea of freedom.
Even a president can be impeached.
Silicon valley.
Land of opportunities, Sundar Pichai the CEO of Google, Twitter CEO Agarwal, Satya nadella CEO of Microsoft.
