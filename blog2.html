        <h2 class="hero-heading">One of my biggest struggles in GMAT was the <br><span class="heading-inverted">RC and CR section</span> in verbal. But thanks to Sandeep Gupta from top1% who has made a series of videos called KTW(know the world)in 24 hours.
        Most of the content comes from those videos. 
              
        </h2>


        <h3 class="hero-heading">
            The passages presented are horrendous for everyone but Americans!<br>
            Why do the Americans not struggle with the verbal section as much as the people from the rest of the world do?<br>
            The answer lies in the content of the passages and CR topics!
            GMAT is predominantly filled with excerpts from American History, and the lack of familiarity is what makes the verbal section tough for the others.
            <br>For example, for an Indian, if the passage is talking something about 1947 in India, we'll already know that this has got something to do with our independence. It'll be something about the Britishers retreating from our land. It'll be about two big nations being formed on our continent!
            Just a mere reference to date has already given you multiple points!
            Since the GMAT is based on American History! It's good to know a little bit of history.
            Now we can't really go and read big fat books for this!
            Here I'll give out chronological bullet points about the significant events that have transpired in the US.

    <p>
         
    To start with the American history we need to rewind a little.<br>
    At the very beginning, we need to talk about <b>Christopher Columbus</b> who accidentally sailed to America when in reality he was trying to find a shorter route to India.
    That was when the <b>New World</b> was discovered.
    Columbus never found this truth out. But nevertheless, this accidental discovery is the reason why we are where we are today.
    Without the daring venture carried out by Columbus we would have never discovered this land, we might have still lived for a couple of centuries believing in the bible according to which the world was the earth was flat, it was only 6000 years old, and the only land that existed was Egypt, Israel, and Cyprus. Based on this if we ever ventured out beyond a point in the ocean we would magically fall off some cliff. This was the level of ridiculousness that the majority of the old world(mainly Europe) believed in.
    And Columbus's discovery did not simply challenge the bible but it completely dismantled it.  It kickstarted the new world.
<br>
<br>
    Columbus is one of the <b>best entrepreneurs</b> the world has ever witnessed.
    He completely entered into an unknown territory.
    Most of the people he approached rejected his idea. Only 1 king in spain agreed to this unpopular venture of his.
    He had no map of where he was going, he had no clue how many men to take with him? No clue about how much food he'll need. But he risked his entire life based on his one idea! Which Kickstarted the New world, the reason why we can call our world Modern today.

    <p>
There are a couple of reasons why America is so successful ! Some predominant factors are:- 
It is the land of <b>opportunity!</b>
Entrepreneurship is celebrated as opposed to communist and solicalist nations where there is little private ownership! 
It's the land of a free enterprise system! <br>
<b>Capitalism</b> is at the heart of US economy!
Geographyically as well it faces little threat from any nation! 
9/11 was the very first significant attack on the US soil.
They are heavily invested in SCI&Tech and R&D. THey've got the <b>strongest Military!</b> Top brands comes from the US!
Europe describes the US as the global hegemonic power.
<br><br>
It can be argued that the US was an <b>accidental superpower</b>. 
Primary reason being the fact the war took place on a foriegn soil for the US. 
They entered at the time when all nations were on the verge of exhaustion. They just had to deliver the <b>'coup de grace'.</b>
But the intent to <b>dominate the world post that was all planned.</b>

The planned domination was the kickstarted by <b>Mr Harry Truman!</b>
In 1945 US dropped Atomic bomb on japan! Uk had already collapsed becasue of the war. 
<br><br>
In 1951, Truman called a meeting with, representatives from top universities, corporates, psychologists,homeland security, department of state,treasury, NSA, Federal Reserve.
The agenda of the meeting was to not just accept that The US as an acciental superpower but also to figure out a way to maintain the same status for the next 50 years.
Truman wasnt very much impressed by the answers he got from the reps.
So he formulated an idea:
He asked Unis to have a maximum investment in RD patents innovation,the goall of research was to win Nobel prizes and not get stuck to mediocre research,<br>
and mainly all the research has to be done keeping in mind the <b>business</b> orientation.
Capitalism flows thorugh every decision that has put America where it is today.

If Americans were dumb then best talents from other nations were encouraged. Even Russians were invited. For this <b>GMAT and GRE</b> were invented.GMAT was started in 1953.

Corporates were told to work with Universities. They were told to not just create <b>products</b> but  
Create <b>brands</b>
,and were told to use <b>psychological slavery.</b> 
<b>Psychologists</b> were used to create this slavery on the consumers.
<b>Hollywood</b> was used to painting a perfect picture of the US. The advertisements made everyone crave for living in the USA.

Homeland security, NSA were told to make life easier for Immigrants. Make the immigrants comfortable. (this was true till 9/11)
The Federal reserve was told to give scholarships to the deserving.

This led to the best of best in the US!

    The above mentioned topics can still be considred modern history!
    But the very first humans!The real natives. 
    <br><b>How did they reach there?</b>
<br><br>
Some 80k years ago! All of the homo sapiens lived on the continent of Africa in a place which is now referred to as <b>Cradle of Humanity</b>.<br>
When we study our genes it can be found that all of us date back to this place in Africa!
<br>
our species was not agrarian back then, we did not do agricultre. So our soruce of food was majorly hunting and gathering whatever we could from the wild vegetation.
<br>
Becasue of this reason the early humans were known for exapnding into new territories looking for food. This is how we humans started from Africa then ventured out into Europe, then to Asia.
<br>
But now the question arises as to how we got to <b>America?</b>
<b>There weren't any boats back then?</b><br>

<br>It was the <b>ICE AGE</b>. 
In search for food we humans ended up reaching till siberia at first.
<b>Now some 13k years back during the ice age the berring sea had frozen.</b><br>
And the food on the present continent was getting  scarce and that's when humans ventured out into the sea and crossing the ~4kms patch,reached <b>America.</b> <br>
